# RubyRat
A simple and portable RAT made in Ruby

# Getting started

### Compiling the client
In order to compile the client, you must use ruby 2.2.2 (`rvm install 2.2.2 && rvm use 2.2.2`) and run `build_client.sh`.

### `build_client.sh` usage
`build_client.sh <osx,win,l32,l64> <EXENAME>`

 `<osx,win,l32,l64>` are the platforms you can compile for.

 `<EXENAME>` is the final name of the outputted executable.


### Starting the interface
To start the RubyRat interface, just type `./rubyrat`. If you want to run the interface in debug mode, run `./rubyrat DEBUG`. As soon as the interface starts, the server will start listening on port 4567 for connections
